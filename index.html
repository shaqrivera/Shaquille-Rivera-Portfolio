          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
              I grew up in Marietta, GA the majority of my
              childhood. Both of my parents are 20+ year US Army veterans.
              In his civilian career, my father was a Full-Stack Developer
              and a Senior Project Manager, which began my interest in coding and developing. I graduated from Marietta High 
              School and shortly after spent the next 6 months living and working
              abroad in a hotel in Germany. This started my career in the service
              industry, where I have worked for the past 5 years. While I am currently
              a bartender in my main line of work, I am also an aspiring
              real estate investor.
